# **Cronwave**
Cronwave is a calendar scheduler integration with the command line utility [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/).
Cronwave takes all your task, their estimated times and schedules them accordingly. It then links with an external caldav server and
pushes the new changes.
## **Feature list/Roadmap**
- [x] sync with private caldav servers such as Radicale
- [ ] google/apple calendar support
- [ ] ui
- [ ] more advanced ai/monte carlo simulation scheduling algorithm
- [ ] integration with [mcps](https://github.com/swaits/mcps)
